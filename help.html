          <h3>How to register a Business Account? </h3>
             
              <p>There are two ways to register a Business Account with FrontApron:</p>
              <p>Method A: First, register as a regular user. Then, after you have logged in, go to the User Profile page. Select Update to a Business Account. and complete the business account upgrade form. After this is completed and validated, your account will be converted to a business account. 
              <p>Method B: Click the Business link in the FrontApron webpage footer and follow the process to register a Business Account. 
              In order to post specials, the Business Account needs be a Store type. Specials can also be posted to any Sub-Business Account that is the Store type. In either case, the payment method must be specified except that during the 3-month free or other FrontApron offered coupon period you might not need to specify the payment method. </p>


            <h3>How to create a multi-store Business Account?</h3>
                <p>Step 1: Register as a Business Account with Front Apron. </p>
                <p>Step 2: From the dropdown menu, select Manage Accounts.</p>
                <p>Step 3: Click the + (Plus) sign next to the Business Account Title. This will bring up a Sub-Business Account creation page.</p>
                <p>Step 4: Complete the creation process and a Sub-Business Account will be created for you. The Sub-Business Account can be designated as a Store by the Sub-Business Account admin, and it can also be used to create its own sub-business account(s).</p>
                <p>For each Business Account, you can also create User Account(s) that will help you manage your business account and that will allow you (and only you) to assign various permissions to these User Account(s) including that of creating specials on your behalf. </p>
                <p>Once a Business Account or Sub-Business Account is claimed as a Store, the account can no longer create sub-business accounts. At the present time, FrontApron does not allow De-select a Store account as a non-Store account. If you want to add another management layer between created store accounts and their current immediate parent account, you can do so by creating more sub-business account(s) using the parent account and let each Store account do a Merge Request to the newly created sub-business account. When the Merge request is accepted by the newly sub-business account, the sub-business account will serve as the new management layer for your organization. </p>

            <h3>How to register a School or a Charity Account?</h3>
               
                <p>There are two ways to register a School or Charity account with FrontApron:</p>
                <p>Method A: Register as a regular user and after successful login, in the user’s Profile page, select Update to a Business Account and complete the School/Charity account upgrade process. Once the process is completed and validated, your account will be converted to a school/charity account with relevant donation information in the dropdown menu.
                Method B: Click the Business link in the FrontApron webpage footer, and follow the process to register as a School/Charity Account.  </p>
                <p>In order for any school or charity to receive 10% FrontApron revenue sharing per year, a school or charity needs to first register with FrontApron and provide the School/Charity Business Name, Address and EIN information. For now, FrontApron limits each regular user to select one school or charity per year for their 10% FrontApron revenue sharing distribution. </p>

               
            <h3>How does the 10% FrontApron revenue sharing work?</h3>
               
                <p>Each year, FrontApron will generate revenue from both business special postings and other revenue sources. FrontApron will share and distribute 10% of annual revenue with schools or charities chosen by FrontApron users. </p>
                <p>FrontApron will calculate the 10% sharing based on each user’s number of Bookmarks on specials.  </p>
                <p>For the special posting related 10% sharing calculation, each Bookmark will share equally with all other Bookmarks on the particular special item.</p>
                <p>For non-special posting related 10% sharing calculation, for each accounting period, FrontApron will tally all Bookmarks for each user and the entire community, and then divide the 10% sharing amount equally to each user’s percentage share of the total Bookmarks of the entire FrontApron community.   </p>
                <p>We will improve the sharing algorithm in the future to create an even more rewarding experience for all of our members and for their designated schools and charities. </p>
